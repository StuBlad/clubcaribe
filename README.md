# Club Caribe remake
This project aims to be a remake of the original Club Caribe world for the NeoHabitat server.

Club Caribe was the released version of Lucasfilm Games "Habitat" virtual world. It was available on the Commodore 64 in the USA via the Quantum Link service, who later became America Online. Habitat was notable for being the worlds first massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. Whilst Habitat was breaking new ground, Q-Link decided to strip the more esoteric elements from the world database, shipping it as "Club Caribe" where it was touted as an idyllic island getaway destination. Caribe was a heavily modified version of regions used in the original Habitat world, along with a bunch of freshly created regions especially for it.

As far as we know, there are no database backups that exist of Club Caribe out there.

We have a lot of screenshots as well as maps of Club Caribe and with that, I'd like to work on recreating that world by hand. If you would like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request.

Here are the main resources we'll be using to make this happen:

There is also a third video which hasn't been uploaded yet.

Bear in mind, there are some corrupted regions being show in the videos so please compare these against the screenshots we have. Also, the screenshots appear to be taken towards the end of Caribes life in 1994 so they should be considered canonical.

The reason we include the NeoHabitat region database here is because a lot of the regions in Caribe were modified versions of Habitat ones. It will save us time if we can identify the base region from Habitat and then make the appropriate tweaks to bring it in line with their Caribe counterpart.

We hope to have more resources available in the future in order to help us reconstruct the world.
